# I Naturalist Student Participation.

## Abstract

The question that will be being addressed is MSUM student related I naturalist data. I natrualist is a program that allows people to track sightings of local fauna on an online database. This online data base allows people to dientify these sightings from all over the world. The data set being used will be from I naturalist and it will be using data specifically from clay county. This exploratory data analysis will be analyzing how MSUM students contribute to observations. Contributions being measured will be how many students use I naturalist outside of class the following year. This will show how much students continue to use the program. 

## Introduction

The question that is being addressed is students continued participation, and their interest in ecology after the class has ended. I naturalist is a program that allows anyone to make observations about local fauna. These observations can then be identified by others online. The wider implications of this information is to see how relevant I naturalist will be within students lives in the future. 



## Methods
Data was extracted from the MSUM ecology i naturalist group in 2019, and 2020. The same was done with all Clay county I naturalist observations in the same year. This was to see if anyone was using I naturalist outside of class time, and if anyone continued to use it the following year. The tables of 2019 and 2020 were bound and filtered to just show user logins for observations. The amount of logins was then graphed on a frequency table.
