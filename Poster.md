## Abstract

The question that will be being addressed is MSUM student related I
naturalist data. I natrualist is a program that allows people to track
sightings of local fauna on an online database. This online data base
allows people to dientify these sightings from all over the world. The
data set being used will be from I naturalist and it will be using data
specifically from clay county. This exploratory data analysis will be
analyzing how MSUM students contribute to observations. Contributions
being measured will be how many students use I naturalist outside of
class and how many observations are made outside of projects.

## Introduction

The question that is being addressed is students continued
participation, and their interest in ecology after the class has ended.
I naturalist is a program that allows anyone to make observations about
local fauna. These observations can then be identified by others online.
The wider implications of this information is to see how relevant I
naturalist will be within students lives in the future.
